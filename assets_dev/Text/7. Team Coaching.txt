TEAM COACHING

Our training practice largely draws on the Neuropower framework, which we believe to be a highly effective and dynamic personal and team development framework. Matt Leggett is an accredited Neuropower Coach and works closely with the broader Neuropower team. Through this network, we are also able to locate coaches who may have a particular specialty or consultants who can address broader business, organisational, or team issues.
