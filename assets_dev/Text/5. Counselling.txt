YOUR FIRST SESSION
At your first session we will discuss your concerns and develop some options together about what kind of approaches or services meet your needs. You will receive some relief from the intensity of the issues you face, and have a clearer way forward. You may like to book a longer session (90 mins) for your first session, especially if attending as a couple.

HOW MANY SESSIONS?
On average most people attend for 5 to 7 sessions however this is not fixed and can be shorter or longer as you require.

WORKING WITH YOUR DOCTOR
Your GP, Psychiatrist or Paediatrician can make a referral for counselling under the Better Access scheme. This enables us to work as a team with your doctor when required, and also for you to claim a Medicare rebate. 

You may also choose to attend counselling independently of your doctor, and forego the Medicare rebate. When you attend for coaching or increased work performance issues, your accountant can advise you if your fee is tax deductable.

We also accept Work Cover Queensland referrals and referrals from V.V.C.S (Veterans & Veteran's Families Counselling Service).
