RESEARCH AND TRAINING
Picture
Enhance Neurofeedback in Brisbane is currently undertaking research to determine if we can identify patterns in the EEG that reflect personality. We are working on this project together with Neuropower in Brisbane and Discovering and Creating Solutions in Melbourne. The research analyses the EEGs of participants who have been typed using the Neuropower personality framework.

Once these patterns are further identified, it will give us clearer protocols for neurofeedback training for peak performance and coaching, with the possibility of enhancing the shift into and between states where we can operate at our best.
