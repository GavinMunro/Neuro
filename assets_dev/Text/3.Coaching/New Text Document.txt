COACHING - BRISBANE
Most people can identify a particular space or zone that they are in when operating at their best. It would be great to spend more of our time in this space, but often we find ourselves dropping out of this state, and into another that limits our capacity, and often brings with it stress and reactivity.

Enhance Coaching focuses on how you can operate in your most effective states, be clear about your goals and develop strategies to ensure you are consistently moving towards them. This can be applied in a range of areas such as reaching peak performance in areas such as sports, work role, leadership and team work, or even “how can I be an exceptional parent or partner?”

Our coaching practice largely draws on the Neuropower framework, which we believe to be a highly effective and dynamic personal and team development framework. Matt Leggett is an accredited Neuropower Coach and works closely with the broader Neuropower team.  Through this network, we are also able to locate coaches who may have a particular specialty or consultants who can address broader business, organisational, or team issues.

The unique service that Enhance offers is the ability to integrate neurofeedback (direct training of your brainwaves) with performance coaching or counselling, allowing you to achieve an optimal level of functioning more quickly and more sustainably.
