                    <p class="mbr-section-lead lead"><br>WHAT IS NEUROFEEDBACK?<br>Neurofeedback is biofeedback using brainwaves. As well as an effective treatment for conditions such as anxiety, depression and ADHD, Neurofeedback can also be used to create peak states for athletes, performers and generally for improved functioning in work and study roles. <br><br>Using electrodes attached to your scalp and ears your brainwaves are picked up and sent to a computer which displays your brainwaves on the screen. On another screen, when efficient brainwaves are used, this signal enables objects to be moved, for example in a game where the goal is to keep one boat ahead of the others. The brain is very adaptable and works at remarkable speeds. Once your brain recognises that it performs more effectively with a different set of feedback signals, it tries to recreate more of that kind of activity.<br><br>The therapists role is to assess and develop the correct protocol for your specific needs, and then to adjust the feedback to make your challenge easier or more difficult. Your brain needs to be challenged enough to get a good “workout” at the effective level of functioning.&nbsp;Over a number of sessions this is reinforced and the brain develops an increased and ongoing ability to produce more of the effective activity (using the right kind of brainwaves more frequently).<br><br>HOW MANY SESSIONS ARE NEEDED?<br>Generally a minimum of 15-20 sessions is required, with some conditions requiring 40 or more sessions. Improvements are generally seen within the first 5 to 10 sessions.<br><br>Neurofeedback sessions take approximately 50 minutes and are usually conducted two or three times per week. Once the gains become more evident, final sessions then ensure that this gain is consolidated and sustained over time. <br><br>HOME SYSTEM<br>Using a remotely supervised home system may also be an option, once gains begin to be seen.<br><br>DOES NEUROFEEDBACK REALLY WORK?<br>Substantial improvements are seen about 80% of the time. Depending on the problem, these changes may include improved sleep, better attention and concentration, calming down of impulsive or hyperactive behaviour, better regulation of mood and emotions, improved academic or work performance and improved verbal and non verbal communication.<br><br>There is a significant and growing body of evidence to support the effectiveness of neurofeedback in a range of areas including ADHD, epilepsy, anxiety, depression, ASD, alcohol issues and PTSD.<br><br>Neurofeedback is also being used for peak performance training for performers, athletes, executives and students. There is some informative literature discussing this practice, however there is not as yet a strong enough base of research in this area. In many cases, the performance issues addressed will reflect varying levels of the conditions mentioned above, such as depression or anxiety. <br><br>The following links provide more detailed information on neurofeedback, and its evidence base, along with links to explore further:<br><br>****LINKS to these sites******LOOP PHOTO from Photo file<br><br>Bibliography of conditions treated.<br>http://www.isnr.net/resources/comprehensive-bibliography.cfm<br><br>EEG Info<br>http://www.eeginfo.com/<br><br>Trauma Center Organisation<br>http://www.traumacenter.org/<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM1Igu9ofpA <br>***** (this video link to go to video page)<br><br>International Society for Neurofeedback and Research (ISNR)<br>http://www.isnr.org/nfbarch/nbiblio.htm<br><br>The Applied Neuroscience Society of Australasia<br>http://www.appliedneuroscience.org.au</p>

He was missing chunks of conversation which was affecting his learning at school and the prospects of him getting his driver's licence were suddenly limited. The neurologist said that was most likely born with the problem and prescribed the mind altering drugs that would help him deal with the condition. But the effect on my son was disturbing. He became more confused and chronically tired, spending hours in the sick bay at school as we tried to find a level of medication that deal with his issues. Finally, our GP suggested an alternative non drug therapy - Neurofeedback.</div><div><br></div><div>Eighteen months later, after intensive Neurofeedback therapy, the neurologist informed us that our son's EEG was completely clear of any signs of epilepsy. Now he has his learner's permit and life has taken on a whole new perspective thanks to Matt Leggett and his work in Neurofeedback.</div></h4>

My diagnosis is complex post-traumatic stress disorder and dissociative disorder. At the time I commenced neurofeedback treatment I was struggling with suicidal thoughts, almost constant anxiety, long standing insomnia and regular dissociative blackouts. These symptoms had been quite long standing and had forced me to leave a professional career. At the point I commenced treatment, my life had contracted to the point that the only time I left the house was to exercise, which was the only way I could even temporarily quell the bodily anxiety.</div><div><br></div><div>Within 3 weeks of starting neurofeedback, I noticed I had gone an entire week without having suicidal thoughts – the longest time in two decades. This was the first sign things were changing. I am now 3 months into treatment and they have not returned.&nbsp;</div></h4>
